# Memo of the project

The problems of this project are facing:

1. Near object is important
   1. Depending on the distance of the object, depth information is different.

2. Salient object is important
   1. Salient Object is that correctly? Two corner situations:
       1. Empty space without any object
       2. Object is too small

3. Repetitive and dense object
   1. Position embedding?
